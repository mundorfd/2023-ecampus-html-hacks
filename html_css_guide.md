To emphasize a quote on Canvas, use the `blockquote` tag:
```
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I say let the world go to hell, but I should always have my tea.&rdquo; ― Fyodor Dostoevsky, Notes from Underground</p>
</blockquote>
```
<br>

#### Output

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I say let the world go to hell, but I should always have my tea.&rdquo; ― Fyodor Dostoevsky, Notes from Underground</p>
</blockquote>

### Ordered (numbered) list.
Copy and paste the existing list into the new `div` container.
