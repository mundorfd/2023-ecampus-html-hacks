# OLC HTML Hacks Workshop Preparation Guide

## What You Will Need

1. Laptop computer with internet access.
2. Access to your learning management system and the ability to author pages (we will be demonstrating in [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas).

### Optional but Useful

#### A Stand-Alone Text Editor

We recommend authoring Canvas pages in an external text editor rather than directly in Canvas. Canvas sometimes removes or alters code it doesn't understand (from typos or non-supported HTML tags).

There are other benefits to using a text editor designed to support HTML development as well, here are a few features to look for that will make learning and writing HTML easier:

- Syntax Highlighting: Color-codes HTML elements for easier reading.
- Auto-Completion: Suggests tags or attributes as you type.
- Error Detection: Highlights mistakes in the code.
- Preview Option: Allows you to see how the HTML will render.
- Find/Replace: Quickly locate and change specific code or text.

##### Text Editors

- [Brackets](https://brackets.io/) - Free, Open-source. Supports multiple platforms.
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - Mac, Windows, Linux support. 
Free to download and try. No enforced time limit for evaluation.

You can also just use a plain text editor, which you likely already have on your computer:

- TextEdit on Mac
- Notepad on Windows
